lots of pipelines

lots of docs on pipelines

nf-core relys on standard `samplesheet.csv` approach
* nf-schema (https://github.com/nextflow-io/nf-schema) for checking pipeline schemas
* nf-schema is a "plug-in"

`nextflow pull` pulls from a git repo to `$HOME/.nextflow/assets/`
* `nextflow drop` will delete them
* repo includes the `nextflow.config`

training workdir is `/workspace/gitpod/nf-customize`

best-practice is to publishDir a `pipeline_info`

there is a `test` profile in `conf/test.config`
* a good way to ensure a pipeline runs out-of-the box

layers of configuration
* https://training.nextflow.io/nf_customize/5_config/
* nextflow.config
* modules/nextflow.config: which came from an include in main nextflow.config
* ...

can add process "labels" as well as "names"
* process-selectors: withName or withLabel

there are standardized `igenomes.config` that can come from AWS iGenomes

CLI configuration:
* `-params-file`
  * refers to a `json` file
* `-c`
  * NEVER use this to define parameters!

predefined configuration scopes
* there are lots of predefined scopes

`nf-core launch` can build a web-gui for a pipeline launch
* https://training.nextflow.io/nf_customize/6_tools/#nf-core-launch
* builds a custom params file
